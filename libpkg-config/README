libpkgconf is a C library which helps to configure compiler and linker flags
for development frameworks. It provides most of the pkgconf's functionality,
which itself is similar to pkg-config. For more information see:

https://git.sr.ht/~kaniini/pkgconf

This package contains the original libpkgconf library source code overlaid with
the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Post questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself at
https://todo.sr.ht/~kaniini/pkgconf. Send build system and packaging-related
feedback to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see
https://lists.build2.org for posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of libpkgconf for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/pkgconf/
